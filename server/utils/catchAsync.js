export default asyncFunction => {
	// when returning a middleware function, Express automatically passes the 3 arguments req, res, next

	// 'error' argument is automatically passed into 'next' function

// if we hadn't put 'asyncFunction' in the returned anonymous function, then it would've been' executed immediately; returning a function is not calling it
// we don't want to execute the the function immediately because we want express to execute it when a request is made
